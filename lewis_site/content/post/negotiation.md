The following are notes I have taken from my negotiation class, one of my favorite classes at Cornell taught by Prof. [Allan Filipowicz](https://www.johnson.cornell.edu/faculty-research/faculty/amf247/).

This document is being updated.

# TL;DR
The most important lessons I have learnt are:

### Dos:
- Try to make the first offer because it is sticky due to anchoring. But if you did not get the first offer, ignore the first offer.
- Preparation (Preparation Preparation) drives performance.
- Understand interests of your counterparty. This allows you to offer more creative solutions that make both parties happy.
- Understand both parties relative preferences to make mutually benefitial trades (grow the pie).
- Build rapport to win trust and honesty.

### Don'ts
- Do not argue against yourself because you never know how valuable this is to them. So, never have self-limiting beliefs.
- Do not say no for the other party. If they don't like the offer they will say it for themselves.
- Do not make another offer without your counterparty making a counteroffer first.


# Negotiations Overview
## Types of negotiation (three interrelated tasks):
- Split the pie
- Grow the pie
- Maintain the relationship

## Accomplish three potentially competing goals:
- Economic outcomes
- Relational outcomes (between you and the counterpart)
- Reputational outcomes (how others view you)

# Split the Pie
## Prepare the floor
- Find your BATNA (and RP), then try to improve it.
- Find the other person's BATNA and RP (<b>But do not reveal yours!
</b>)

Now ignore BATNA and aim for the ceiling. Ask yourself 3 questions:
- Where is the top of the market?
- Why should you be there (self-limiting beliefs)?
- Why are you worth top of market to them?
