      - name: Anomaly Detection in the U.S. Electricity Grid data 
        image: '/images/portfolio/anomaly.png'
        link: https://github.com/Lewis727/ORIE-5741-Data-Slayer
        description: 'This project aims to identify anomalies in the U.S. electricity grid data to help mitigate the impact of data quality issues for electricity traders, among others. The project uses a dataset from EIA that contains hourly electric grid data for the NW region with over 66000 hourly observations. We will implement various semi-supervised/supervised algorithms and compare their performance. Additionally, we will perform time series analysis to replace the anomalous values.'

        description: 'Forex trading involves buying and selling currency pairs to profit from exchange rate fluctuations. With the rise of computer algorithms, forex trading now takes place in high-frequency settings. This research investigates the characteristics of high-frequency forex data, specifically the EUR/USD pair, and examines correlations between present and future volatility and returns. Traders can benefit from extreme volatility through volatility trading, and the research also explores the independence between present and future returns for building time series prediction models.'
